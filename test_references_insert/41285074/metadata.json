  "abstract": "Zearalenone (ZEN) is predominantly generated by Fusarium graminearum. This mycotoxin is also inscribed in the carcinogen inventory issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization. The primary target organ of ZEN is the reproductive system of female animals, though it also exerts specific impacts on male animals. Therefore, sensitive detection of this toxin is urgently needed. In this study, Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> and tri-n-propylamine (TPrA) were self-assembled into the pores of hydrophobic ionic liquid (HIL) functionalized HKUST-1, thereby preparing an ultra-sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microreactor to detect zearalenone (ZEN). In particular, the introduction of HIL changes the hydrophilic surface of HKUST-1 into a hydrophobic surface, and improves the ECL performance and stability of Ru@HKUST-1/Pd in aqueous solution. Furthermore, Au/Ni-Co NCs exhibited excellent quenching ability in this ECL system. HIL/Ru@HKUST-1/Pd as a luminophor and Au/Ni-Co NCs as a quencher were utilized to construct a sensor for the ZEN analysis. Under the optimized experimental parameters, the limit of detection of ZEN was determined to be 20 fg/mL (S/N = 3). This detection method addresses the issues of high cost and low sensitivity of existing methods, thereby ensuring food safety and the economic well-being of the livestock industry."
