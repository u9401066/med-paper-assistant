# Project Context

## Goals
- Develop a suite for assisting in writing medical papers.
- Provide a VSCode-compatible tool/MCP for literature search (usable by Copilot/Antigravity).
- Allow user-defined literature search parameters.
- **Reference Management**: Save selected literature with metadata and content (abstract/full text) to a local `references/` directory.
- Assist in converting ideas into documentation (similar to Speckit).
- Support various journal format templates.
- Generate first drafts with correct citations and formatting.

## Project Description
This project is a Medical Paper Writing Assistant designed to streamline the research and writing process for medical professionals. It integrates with VSCode via MCP (Model Context Protocol) to provide intelligent literature search, formatting, and drafting capabilities. It aims to bridge the gap between raw ideas and submission-ready manuscripts.
