# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Bandit-facing runtime guards**: Replaced release-blocking runtime `assert` usage in writing hook constants plus MCP stats and pipeline gate tools with explicit exceptions so security scans no longer flag `B101 assert_used` on these validation paths
- **VS Marketplace banner rendering**: Switched the extension README banner image to an absolute GitHub raw URL so Marketplace stops rewriting the path against the repository root and dropping the `vscode-extension/` segment

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Repository visual asset set**: Added overview, architecture, and Auto Paper flow SVG assets under `docs/assets/` so the repository now has first-party graphics for the main README and guide entrypoints
- **VSX branding assets**: Added the MedPaper Assistant icon and marketplace banner assets under `vscode-extension/resources/` to give the extension listing a consistent visual system

### Changed

- **Bilingual documentation entrypoints**: Synced `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, and `docs/auto-paper-guide.md` to use the new overview, architecture, and pipeline visuals instead of relying on text-only entrypoints
- **VS Code extension marketplace presentation**: Updated `vscode-extension/README.md` and `vscode-extension/package.json` so the extension advertises the new icon plus gallery banner configuration in line with the repository visuals

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Release gate normalization**: absorbed repository-wide EOF, Prettier, and Ruff auto-fixes across prompts, skills, tests, and bundle helper scripts so `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` no longer leaves release work in a half-formatted state
- **Hook and harness revalidation**: rechecked the hook guard, embedded hooks, audit hooks, MCP boot verification, install smoke, greedy MCP smoke, full fast pytest suite, and VS Code extension tests before tagging the marketplace build

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Compact tool surface default**: `mdpaper` now supports `MEDPAPER_TOOL_SURFACE=full|compact`; default runtime in workspace/VSX paths is compact, exposing 44 tools while retaining 94 tools in full mode
- **Documentation alignment for release**: Synced `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, and `vscode-extension/README.md` to describe full/compact counts and facade-first behavior consistently

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Unsupported macOS runner lane**: Removed the `macos-13` cross-platform smoke lane from CI and release matrices because GitHub Actions resolves it to an unsupported `macos-13-us-default` configuration for this repository, which was forcing otherwise healthy release runs to end as `cancelled`

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Windows release smoke quoting**: Replaced inline `python -c` MCP boot checks in CI/release workflows with the shared `scripts/verify_mcp_server_boot.py` runner so PowerShell quoting and Unicode parsing no longer break the Windows cross-platform smoke job

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform hook guard path rebasing**: `scripts/copilot_hook_guard.py` now prefers the full workspace path signature before falling back to repo-name rebasing, preventing duplicated workspace segments such as `.../med-paper-assistant/med-paper-assistant/...` in GitHub Actions workspaces
- **Release smoke guard regressions**: `tests/test_copilot_hook_guard.py` now covers duplicated-workspace-path scenarios for patch parsing, protected-path denial, and nested path extraction so the release smoke suite stays stable across GitHub-hosted runners

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Facade-first MCP surface**: Added stable public entrypoints for project/workspace, review/pipeline, and export flows via `project_action`, `workspace_state_action`, `run_quality_checks`, `pipeline_action`, `export_document`, and `inspect_export`, plus lightweight MCP resources for workspace state, project catalog, and template catalog
- **Greedy MCP smoke runner**: Added `scripts/greedy_mcp_tool_smoke.py` with isolated fixture setup, CI-friendly JSON v2 output, stable summary formatting, and categorized skip reporting (`interactive`, `external`, `other`) for regression diffs
- **Release-grade smoke coverage**: Added façade routing tests, legacy deprecation guidance tests, real MCP stdio workspace smoke, greedy smoke report tests, and VS Code extension host smoke covering activation, MCP provider registration, and a core command path
- **Runtime mode guard**: Added `.github/hooks/mode-guard.json` and `scripts/copilot_hook_guard.py` so protected-path edits and destructive terminal commands are checked consistently across Windows-safe `apply_patch` and terminal flows

### Changed

- **First-party orchestration guidance**: Updated root prompts, skills, bundled instructions, and extension autopaper guidance so first-party flows prefer façade verbs over legacy compatibility verbs, with explicit deprecation messaging for legacy public tools
- **VS Code extension packaging**: Switched bundle/build validation to a manifest-driven model using `vscode-extension/bundle-manifest.json` plus shared Node-based bundle and validate scripts, and reused the same manifest data in packaging tests and workflow assertions
- **CI and release validation**: Expanded CI/release smoke to cover `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-13`, and `macos-14`, added committed bundle drift checks before sync/build steps, and routed `npm run validate` through a platform-aware launcher for cross-platform parity

### Fixed

- **Stable smoke diff normalization**: Normalized Windows path separators and workspace-root substitutions in greedy smoke summaries so CI diffs stay stable across operating systems
- **Cross-platform VSX assertions**: Reworked extension path assertions and packaging checks to use native path handling and shared command manifests, preventing Windows-only false negatives
- **Documentation parity**: Synced repository and VSX documentation with the façade-first MCP surface, stable smoke coverage, and current cross-platform validation flow

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **VSX marketplace MCP deduplication**: `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` now detects when another installed VS Code extension already provides `PubMed Search` or `Zotero Keeper` MCP servers and skips both persistent tool installation and duplicate MCP registration, preventing doubled tool lists in Copilot Chat
- **VSX persistent tool upgrades**: `vscode-extension/src/uvManager.ts` now runs `uv tool upgrade` for already-installed managed tools during activation, so older machine-level installs are refreshed on newer extension releases instead of staying pinned silently
- **VSX documentation alignment**: Synced root `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`, and `vscode-extension/README.md` with current MCP counts, 11-phase Auto Paper wording, persistent-install behavior, and external VSX deduplication notes
- **Cross-platform setup reproducibility**: `scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/setup.ps1`, and `vscode-extension/scripts/build.sh` no longer auto-track remote submodule HEAD during install/build; they now use repository-pinned submodule commits, generate the full repo `.vscode/mcp.json` shape consistently, and verify current MedPaper/CGU startup paths
- **JSONC mcp.json support**: `scripts/migrate_mcp_json.py` now strips `//` comments from `.vscode/mcp.json` before parsing, preventing failures when VS Code leaves JSONC-style comments in the config
- **setup.sh heredoc template corruption**: Rewrote the mcp.json heredoc block with consistent 2-space indentation and all 6 canonical servers, fixing structural corruption from overlapping patches
- **CHANGELOG first-line corruption**: Removed garbage prefix from `CHANGELOG.md` first line that would fail Prettier CI checks
- **Ruff lint/format compliance**: Fixed E402 import ordering and formatting issues in new test files to pass CI checks

### Added

- **MCP progress notifications for long-running tools**: Audit/review pipeline tools now use FastMCP `Context.report_progress()` when the client provides a progress token, covering phase validation, pipeline heartbeat, review-round start/submit, quality audit, meta-learning, data artifact validation, writing hooks, and review hooks
- **Cross-platform migration script** (`scripts/migrate_mcp_json.py`): Non-destructive mcp.json migration — detects missing servers, normalizes JSONC→JSON, creates timestamped backups; shared loader used by `smoke_test.py`
- **Installation smoke test** (`scripts/smoke_test.py`): 13-check cross-platform verification covering environment, core imports, MCP server creation, CGU integration, mcp.json validation, git submodules, and migration dry-run

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Top 20 anesthesiology journal profiles**: Added `templates/journal-profiles/` with 20 ready-to-use journal YAML presets, `_index.yaml`, README, and `scripts/generate_journal_profiles.py` to regenerate the catalog from source metadata
- **Paper pre-commit hook (P-series)**: New `scripts/hooks/paper_precommit.py` registered in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — runs P1/P2/P4/P5/P7 quality checks automatically on `git commit`, blocking on CRITICAL issues
- **Embedded post-write hooks**: `write_draft` and `patch_draft` now auto-run A-series hooks (A1–A7, B9, B10, B15) after successful write — agent cannot skip, non-blocking advisory report appended to output
- **B2 protected content guard**: `patch_draft` now blocks modification of 🔒-marked sections in `concept.md` — prevents agent from altering NOVELTY STATEMENT or KEY SELLING POINTS without user approval
- **Weak-model guardrails expansion**: Added Code-Enforced B2/C2/P6 coverage, deprecated `save_reference()` warning + telemetry, and a dedicated weak-model regression suite in `tests/test_weak_model_guardrails.py`
- **Domain constraint expansion**: Added shared anti-AI vocabulary core and broader paper-type coverage for `meta-analysis`, `review-article`, `letter`, and `other`, plus structural/temporal/evidential constraints such as methods-before-results, minimum references, and section-overlap detection

### Fixed

- **Hook batch runner**: `run_post_manuscript_hooks()` now calls C10 (full manuscript validation), C11 (citation distribution), C12 (citation decision audit), C13 (figure/table quality) — previously defined in mixin but not wired into the batch runner
- **MCP hook aliases**: `audit_hooks.py` ALL set now includes A7 (reference sufficiency) and C7B (asset coverage); POST-WRITE +A7, POST-MANUSCRIPT +C7B; docstring corrected from 37→40 hooks
- **Hook effectiveness tracker**: `HOOK_CATEGORIES` now tracks P (pre-commit) and G (git-hooks) event categories
- **Consistency checker accuracy**: `scripts/check_consistency.py` now understands sub-hooks like `A3b`, counts 78 hooks correctly, and validates P/G hook categories instead of misreporting false failures
- **Documentation alignment**: AGENTS.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `vscode-extension/copilot-instructions.md`, and `vscode-extension/README.md` now reflect 78 hooks / 55 Code-Enforced / 23 Agent-Driven and 88 MCP tools consistently
- **VSX bundled parity**: Re-synced bundled Python sources and bundled skills with workspace source so local `vitest` sync checks and packaged extension content match the repository state

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Hook A3c: Voice Consistency Detector (Anti-AI 語體一致性偵測)**:

  - New Code-Enforced hook `check_voice_consistency()` in `_post_write.py` — detects paragraph-level style breaks via z-score outlier analysis
  - Per-paragraph metrics: avg_sent_len, avg_word_len, type_token_ratio, punct_complexity
  - Document baseline computation (mean + std per metric)
  - Outlier detection (z-score > 1.8) + vocabulary sophistication gap (max−min avg_word_len > 1.2)
  - Catches the #1 human-reviewer signal: ESL paragraphs suddenly switching to polished corporate-academic prose
  - Registered in WritingHooksEngine batch runner (`run_post_write_hooks`) and pre-commit P2c delegation
  - Integrated into R5 post-review anti-AI gate (now runs A3 + A3b + A3c)
  - MCP dispatch: `run_writing_hooks(hooks="A3C")` available in ALL and POST-WRITE hook sets
  - 18 new tests covering uniform text, mixed voice detection, sophistication gap, custom thresholds, markdown handling, and batch integration
  - Hook count: 77 → 78 (36 Code-Enforced / 42 Agent-Driven)

- **Dual-Subagent Anti-AI Cross-Audit Protocol (Stage C3)**:

  - SKILL.md Stage C3 rewritten: three-layer code scan (A3+A3B+A3C) → agent self-review (6 criteria incl. voice breaks) → dual-subagent cross-audit → verification
  - Concept-Challenger: new Anti-AI Surface Scanner role (blacklist + structural signals + GPTZero risk assessment)
  - Domain-Reviewer: new Voice Analyst role (per-paragraph AI probability scoring 1-5, ESL baseline analysis, TOP 5 suspicious sentences)
  - Cross-comparison protocol: 🔴 both flag → must rewrite, ⚠️ one flags → judge, ✅ both safe → pass

- **Asset Review Receipt Hard Gate for Figures/Tables**:

  - New analysis tool `review_asset_for_insertion()` records auditable review receipts in `.audit/data-artifacts.yaml`
  - `insert_figure()` / `insert_table()` now BLOCK caption registration unless a matching review receipt exists first
  - Phase 5 gate now validates planned figure/table captions are backed by review receipts
  - Hook F / `validate_data_artifacts()` now report missing or incomplete asset review receipts as gate-blocking issues
  - 1 new targeted tool test file + expanded Phase 5 / Hook F coverage

- **Paper-Type-Aware Reference Minimum Enforcement (Hook A7 + Phase 2 Gate)**:
  - New Hook A7 `check_reference_sufficiency()` — Code-Enforced pre-write gate that blocks writing when reference library is insufficient
  - Phase 2 Gate now paper-type-aware: reads `paper.type` from `journal-profile.yaml`, resolves minimum via 3-tier chain
  - Per-type minimums: original-research (20), review-article (30), systematic-review (40), meta-analysis (40), case-report (8), letter (5), fallback (15)
  - `journal-profile.template.yaml`: new `minimum_reference_limits` field for per-project override
  - `DomainConstraintEngine`: B003 `minimum_references` BOUNDARY constraint added to all 3 paper types
  - Phase 3+ prerequisite checks also paper-type-aware (can't bypass by skipping Phase 2)
  - 8 new A7 hook tests + 7 new Phase 2 gate tests (839 tests total)
  - Hook count: 76 → 77 (35 Code-Enforced / 42 Agent-Driven)
- **Humanizer Anti-AI Enhancement**:
  - `ANTI_AI_PHRASES`: 76 → 133 phrases across 12 semantic categories (overly_formal, unnecessary_hedging, ai_conclusions, filler_boosters, generic_linking, hollow_emphasis, ai_structuring, inflated_academic, ai_discourse, passive_deflectors, nominalised_verbs, hollow_intensifiers)
  - `AI_TRANSITION_WORDS`: 25 → 33 (added: Nevertheless, Conversely, Correspondingly, Notably, Importantly, Significantly, Fundamentally, Substantially)
  - 4 new A3b structural pattern checks: #6 negative parallelism, #7 copula avoidance, #8 em dash overuse, #9 false ranges (X to Y)
  - 12 new tests for anti-AI detection (826 Python tests total)
- **VS Code Copilot Lifecycle Hooks**:
  - 7 hook scripts: `session-init.sh`, `prompt-analyzer.sh`, `pre-tool-guard.sh`, `post-tool-check.sh`, `pre-compact-save.sh`, `subagent-init.sh`, `session-stop.sh`
  - `.github/hooks/mdpaper-lifecycle.json` configuration
  - Design doc: `docs/design/copilot-lifecycle-hooks.md`
  - State communication via `.github/hooks/_state/` (gitignored)
  - Graceful degradation when jq is not installed

### Fixed

- **Asset Review Receipt — Caption Normalization & Auto-Review**:
  - Caption comparison now uses `_normalize_caption()` — strips trailing punctuation, whitespace, and lowercases before matching (fixes brittle exact-match failures)
  - `insert_table()` with inline `table_content` now auto-records review receipt (agent has full content access), eliminating redundant `review_asset_for_insertion()` call
  - File-based tables (no `table_content`) still require explicit review receipt (hard gate preserved)
  - 5 new tests: `TestCaptionNormalization` (4 unit tests) + auto-review integration test
- **MCP Instructions**: Removed ghost tool `save_diagram_standalone` (merged into `save_diagram`), added missing `insert_figure`/`insert_table`/`list_assets` to DATA ANALYSIS section, updated DIAGRAM WORKFLOW
- **Tool count drift**: 85 → 86 tools (review/ 21 → 22), synced across 5 files via `sync_repo_counts.py --fix`

### Changed

- **Tool count**: 86 → 88 tools (analysis/ 9 → 10: `review_asset_for_insertion`, review/ 22 → 23: `approve_concept_review`)
- **Hook count**: 76 → 78 (34 → 36 Code-Enforced): added A3c Voice Consistency + A7 Reference Sufficiency
- **VSX Extension**: Synced `copilot-instructions.md` + `auto-paper/SKILL.md`, added 3 research skills (`memory-checkpoint`, `memory-updater`, `project-init`)

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **VSX Zero-Config Marketplace Mode**:
  - `uvManager.ts` — cross-platform uv auto-detection + headless installation (Windows PowerShell / Unix curl)
  - `ensureUvReady()` — auto-install uv on activation with VS Code progress notification
  - Marketplace mode uses `uvx med-paper-assistant` from PyPI (complete isolation, no PYTHONPATH contamination)
  - CGU marketplace mode uses `uvx creativity-generation-unit`
- **VSX Testability Refactor**:
  - `extensionHelpers.ts` — 6 pure functions extracted from `extension.ts` (no vscode API dependency): `shouldSkipMcpRegistration`, `isDevWorkspace`, `isMedPaperProject`, `determinePythonPath`, `countMissingBundledItems`, `buildDevPythonPath`
  - `extensionHelpers.test.ts` — 30 tests covering all extracted helpers
  - `packaging.test.ts` — 21 tests for manifest schema, `.vscodeignore`, module structure, version consistency
  - `uvManager.test.ts` — 20 tests (expanded from 17) including async `findUvPath` tests

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `shouldSkipMcpRegistration()` now checks both `"mdpaper"` server name AND `med_paper_assistant` module path — prevents skipping when user has unrelated `mcp.json` entries
- **Critical**: `determinePythonPath()` only returns `'uv'` fallback for `med-paper-assistant` pyproject.toml — prevents wrongly treating any `pyproject.toml` as a valid Python path

### Changed

- VSX vitest: 52 → **106 passed** (+54 new tests across 4 test files)
- CGU bundled tools updated to latest version

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `_strip_references_section()` greedy regex (`.*` with `re.DOTALL`) deleted all content after `## References` — any sections like `## Appendix` or `## Supplementary Materials` were silently lost during export. Fixed to non-greedy `.*?(?=\n## |\Z)` with lookahead.
- 2 regression tests added for post-References content preservation

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Pre-export citation gate (C5 HARD GATE)**: `export_docx()` and `export_pdf()` now run Hook C5 (Wikilink Resolvable) as a blocking gate — export is refused if any `[[wikilink]]` citations cannot be resolved to saved references
- **Strict mode for `prepare_for_pandoc()`**: New `strict=True` parameter raises `ValueError` on unresolved citation keys (used by `export_docx/pdf` internally as second defense layer)
- **Word export residual wikilink warning**: `save_document()` scans the final Word document for any remaining `[[...]]` patterns and warns the user
- 9 new tests covering all three defense layers

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Critical**: MCP server now uses `MEDPAPER_BASE_DIR` env var (set by VSX extension to workspace folder) instead of CWD for `projects/` and `logs/` paths — fixes end-user issue where output went to extension install directory instead of workspace

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **CI**: Add `# nosec B110` to `checkpoint.py` — bandit false positive on intentional try/except/pass causing CI failure

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Dashboard ThemeProvider**: Replace `setState`-in-effect with `useSyncExternalStore` for hydration detection (ESLint `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`)
- **Dashboard DrawioEditor**: Fix `ExportFormats` type mismatch (`xml` → `xmlsvg`), remove unsupported `style` prop
- **Dashboard stats/route.ts**: Next.js 16 `params` type changed to `Promise<>` with `await`
- **sync_repo_counts.py**: Remove unused `warnings` variable (ruff F841)
- **Bundled Python sync**: Fix rsync target to correct `bundled/tool/` path

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **VSX Extension Completeness**:
  - `agents/` directory with 9 bundled `.agent.md` files (concept-challenger, domain-reviewer, literature-searcher, meta-learner, methodology-reviewer, paper-reviewer, reference-analyzer, review-orchestrator, statistics-reviewer)
  - `autoScaffoldIfNeeded()` — auto-detect missing skills/agents/prompts and prompt user
  - `build.sh` step 2d — agent bundle copy
  - `validate-build.sh` V3c — agent sync validation
  - `validateBundledAgents()` utility function
  - `mdpaper.audit` bundled prompt
  - Agent sync tests (vitest)
- **macOS / VS Code Insiders Compatibility**:
  - MCP environment inherits `PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, `USERPROFILE` — fixes homebrew `uv`/`uvx`/`git` discovery on macOS
  - `getPythonArgs` supports versioned Python names (`python3.12`, `python3.11`) via regex
  - New test: versioned Python (homebrew/macOS) path matching
- **Dynamic Count Sync Script** (`scripts/sync_repo_counts.py`): AST-based counting of all repo metrics, auto-sync into 7 docs, 43 stale counts auto-fixed
- **ReviewHooksEngine** (`R1-R6`): Review report depth, author response completeness, EQUATOR compliance, review-fix traceability, post-review anti-AI, citation budget
- **EXPECTED_HOOKS**: 40→58 (added B9-B16, C10-C13, R1-R6)
- **`reset_review_loop` MCP tool**: Stuck review state recovery
- **`citeproc-py`**: Moved to core dependencies (previously optional)

### Fixed

- **Bug 1 (Critical)**: `_compute_manuscript_hash()` now hashes ALL `.md` files in `drafts/` via sorted glob — resolves review pipeline deadlock when using multi-file drafts
- **Bug 2 (Critical)**: `citeproc-py` import failure crashes — added try/except lazy import with `_CITEPROC_AVAILABLE` flag at all 3 usage points
- **Bug 3 (Medium)**: `start_document_session` required `template_name` even when no templates available — now optional, creates blank document when omitted
- **Bug 4 (Medium)**: Writing Hooks false positives:
  - A1: Added `_strip_frontmatter()` to exclude YAML frontmatter from word counts
  - A6: Added statistical notation regex exclusion (F-tests, p-values, η²p, CI, OR/HR/RR, β, SD/SE) from n-gram overlap detection
- **Bug 5 (Minor)**: `export_pdf` citeproc crash chain — covered by Bug 2 lazy import guards
- **MCP server env**: Child processes (uv/uvx/git) now inherit system PATH on macOS — prevents "command not found" errors
- **Hash mismatch error messages**: Added diagnostic info showing current vs expected hashes

### Changed

- MCP tools: **85** (review/ 20→21 with reset_review_loop)
- Hook architecture: **76 checks** (34 Code-Enforced / 42 Agent-Driven)
- Python tests: 698 → **730 passed** (excl. external-dep tests)

### Fixed

- **C6 Word Count (ICMJE Convention)**: Body-only counting — excludes Abstract, References, Tables (markdown `| |` rows), Figure legends, Acknowledgments, Author info. New helpers: `BODY_SECTIONS` constant (12 sections), `_strip_markdown_tables()`, `_extract_body_word_count()`. Journal profile override via `counts_toward_total` flag.
