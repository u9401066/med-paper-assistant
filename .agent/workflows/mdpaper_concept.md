1. **Update Concept**: Ask the user for their research hypothesis, methodology, or key results. Update `concept.md` with this information.
2. **Analyze Gaps**: Check `concept.md` for missing sections (Title, Hypothesis, Methods, Results, References).
3. **Refine**: Ask clarifying questions to fill in the gaps.
